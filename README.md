# Nim-svelte

Heavily inspired by [the nim theme](https://nim-fawn.vercel.app/) but written in Svelte
instead of React/Next.js. If you decide to use this repo, please credit the original
author [ibelick](https://github.com/ibelick/nim) and not me.

### Setup and Run

Clone, install packages and start the node server. It starts on port 5173 by default.

```
git clone https://github.com/sriram-rao/sriram-rao.github.io.git
cd sriram-rao.github.io
npm install
npm run dev
```
